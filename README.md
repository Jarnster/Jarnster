## 📜 My Development Journey  
I started programming when I was around 10 years old, initially working with PHP and Lua. Over time, my curiosity led me to explore more languages, expanding my skill set with Node.js, Python, and C#.  

As I grew older, I delved into game development, creating my own games and contributing to many others. Along the way, I developed a passion for building robust systems and APIs, which remains my primary focus today.
