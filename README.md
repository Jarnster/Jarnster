## üëã  Who I am 

I'm a 17-year-old passionate student developer, with a primary focus on APIs, innovative systems, services, cybersecurity, and game development.

Occasionally, I contribute to open-source projects.

Feel free to open Issues, create PRs, or collaborate in any way on my repositories. I'm always eager to improve and collaborate with others!

# Some of My Personal Projects:

### [VyConnect](https://github.com/Jarnster/VyConnect):
Easily manage and configure multiple **[VyOS](https://vyos.io/) routers** without having to configure each one individually via CLI - all without compromising on security. VyConnect communicates with the routers using the official VyOS REST API, removing the need for full SSH access and avoiding the risks associated with storing plain-text credentials or using insecure third-party scripts.

## üìú My Development Journey  
I began programming at around 11 years old, starting with PHP and Lua. Over time, my curiosity led me to explore more languages, expanding my skill set with Node.js, Python, and C#.

As I got older, I delved deeper into game development, creating my own projects and contributing to others. Along the way, I developed a passion for cybersecurity and building robust systems and APIs, which remain my primary focus today.

I'm currently studying computer science in high school and constantly working on improving my skills.
