## üëã  Who I am 

I'm a 17-year-old passionate student developer, with a primary focus on APIs, innovative systems, services, cybersecurity, and game development.

Occasionally, I contribute to open-source projects.

Feel free to open Issues, create PRs, or collaborate in any way on my repositories. I'm always eager to improve and collaborate with others!

Some things I've made:

### [VyConnect](https://github.com/Jarnster/VyConnect):
Easily manage and configure multiple **VyOS routers** without needing to configure them individually via CLI.

### [RBXConnectionManager](Ultray-Studios/RBXConnectionManager):
Lightweight module for managing RBXScriptConnection objects in Roblox. It allows for easy connection handling, automatic cleanup, and optional event monitoring.

## üìú My Development Journey  
I began programming at around 11 years old, starting with PHP and Lua. Over time, my curiosity led me to explore more languages, expanding my skill set with Node.js, Python, and C#.

As I got older, I delved deeper into game development, creating my own projects and contributing to others. Along the way, I developed a passion for cybersecurity and building robust systems and APIs, which remain my primary focus today.

I'm currently studying computer science in high school and constantly working on improving my skills.
