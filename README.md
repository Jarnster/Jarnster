## üìú My Development Journey  
I began programming at around 11 years old, starting with PHP and Lua. Over time, my curiosity led me to explore more languages, expanding my skill set with Node.js, Python, and C#.

As I got older, I delved deeper into game development, creating my own projects and contributing to others. Along the way, I developed a passion for cybersecurity and building robust systems and APIs, which remain my primary focus today.

I'm currently studying computer science in high school and constantly working on improving my skills.
